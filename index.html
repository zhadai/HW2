<h2 class="titletop"> About Me </h2>
<p> 

In Chinese Zhaoyang means the rising sun. The reason why my parents gave this name to me is just because I was born in the morning. 
I grew up in Beijing, it's a very modern city. To be honest, I don't like Beijing's weather very much, it's dry and stuffy. 
Especially in recent years, I can hardly see blue sky, it's really awful. But Beijing has one thing that much better that any other city, it is the food. 
The roast duck is the most famous food in Beijing, it's really tasty.
</p>

<p>

Now, I am a senior student in the University of Iowa. My major is MIS and Finance. I feel really good here, people are nice, food is nice, especially 
the weather here is very nice. I really enjoy my university life in here.
